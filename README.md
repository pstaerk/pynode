# PyNode - A node library for python

I want to have something like [blender's node system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/index.html), but there is no real good library that already does this in python.

## Todos
 - [x] Draw nodes
 - [ ] Connect them
 - [ ] Make them do something useful
